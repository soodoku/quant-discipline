"1",NA,"8805","The U.S. government established a national weather organization in 1870.
Changes in Great Lakes cargo and hull losses, and shipping rates from
Chicago to Buffalo, provide evidence of the value of storm warnings on
the Great Lakes. Nearly half of the Great Lakes storm-warning stations
were closed during the fall of 1883 because of appropriations
reductions. This exogenous shock permits the econometric estimation of
the value of storm-warning locations on the Great Lakes. The results
indicate that the social rate of return for weather expenditures during
the Weather Bureau's founding period was at least 60 percent."
"2",NA,"8805","This article studies how equity ownership and corporate control were
separated in the United States. Initially, railroads and industrial
firms were tightly controlled by a few shareholders; this situation was
altered in the 1890s by massive mergers and reorganizations, which
allowed private banks to control railroads and industrial firms. Between
1912 and 1939, bank control faded away as a result of a political
reaction against financial institutions. Using stock-market data from
1914, the author shows that the eviction of banks from corporate boards
depressed firm values by about 7 percent and that part of this value
came from cartelization."
"3",NA,"8805","The transition to a market economy has produced a substantial and rapid
change in the wage structure in Russia. Household surveys taken before
and after the transition indicate that overall wage inequality nearly
doubled from 1991 to 1994 and has reached a level higher than that in
the United States. Returns to both measured skills (education,
occupation) and unmeasured skills within groups have increased
considerably. Skill premiums across experience groups, however, have
become more compressed and relative wages of older workers have
declined. In addition, female wages have declined relative to male wages
across all percentiles of the wage distribution."
"4",NA,"8805","The authors investigate the remarkably short unemployment spells in the
Czech Republic compared to Slovakia and other Central and East European
economies. They estimate hazard functions and find that 40 to 5O percent
of the difference in unemployment durations between the two republics is
accounted for by differences in demographics and demand conditions. The
remainder is explained by differences in coefficients, proxying the
behavior of firms, individuals, and institutions. In both republics, the
unemployment compensation system has a moderately negative effect on the
exit rate from unemployment. Policymakers, hence, have latitude in
providing adequate social safety nets without jeopardizing efficiency."
"5",NA,"8805","The government's incentives to bail out inefficient projects are
determined by the trade-off between political benefits and economic
costs, the latter depending on the decentralization of government. Two
effects of federalism are derived: first, fiscal competition among local
governments under factor mobility increases the opportunity costs of
bailout and, thus, serves as a commitment device (the 'competition
effect'); second, monetary centralization, together with fiscal
decentralization, induces a conflict of interests and, thus, may harden
budget constraints and reduce inflation (the 'checks and balance
effect'). The authors' analysis is used to interpret China's recent
experience of transition to a market economy."
"6",NA,"8805","The authors develop a positive theory of how interest-group competition
shapes the organization of Congress and use it to explain campaign
contribution patterns in financial services. Since interest groups
cannot enforce fee-for-service contracts with legislators, legislators
have an incentive to create specialized, standing committees which
foster repeated dealing between interests and committee members. The
resulting reputational equilibrium supports high contributions and high
legislative effort for the interests. Contribution patterns by competing
interests in the congressional battle over whether banks can enter new
businesses support the theory, which also has implications for term
limits and campaign reform."
"7",NA,"8805","This paper explores leadership within organizations. Leadership is
distinct from authority because following a leader is a voluntary,
rather than coerced, activity of the followers. This paper considers how
a leader induces rational agents to follow her in situations when the
leader has incentives to mislead them."
"8",NA,"8805","Subjective uncertainty is characterized by ambiguity if the
decisionmaker has an imprecise knowledge of the probabilities of
payoff-relevant events. In such an instance, subjective beliefs are
better represented by a set of probability functions than by a unique
probability function. An ambiguity-averse decisionmaker adjusts his
choice on the side of caution in response to his imprecise knowledge of
the odds. This paper shows that ambiguity aversion can explain the
existence of incomplete contracts. The contextual setting is the
investment hold-up model which has been the focus of much of the
research on incomplete contracts."
"9",NA,"8805","Backward vertical integration by a dominant firm into an upstream
competitive industry causes both input and output prices to rise. The
dominant firm's advantage may or may not offset the negative effect of
higher prices on social welfare. Whether it does depends on a simple
indicator derived from input and output market shares and the degree of
prior vertical integration. A vertical merger is similar to a
hypothetical horizontal merger, suggesting that vertical merger policy
for this industry should be similar to horizontal merger policy. The
dominant firm model yields an observable sufficient indicator of
welfare-improving vertical mergers."
"10",NA,"8805","Patent litigation reveals important information about the validity of
the contested patent to other potential entrants. This paper explores
the implications of such informational externalities for entry dynamics
in the presence of multiple potential entrants. The nature of the entry
game can be one of either waiting or preemption depending on the degree
of patent protection. Therefore, the payoffs for the patentee and the
initial imitator are discontinuous in the degree of patent protection.
Furthermore, strengthening intellectual property rights is not
necessarily desirable for the patentee. The analysis may also help
explain the apparently puzzling practice of delaying patent suits."
"11",NA,"8805","Does national market size matter for industrial structure? This has been
suggested by theoretical work on 'home market' effects. In the present
paper, the author shows that what previously was regarded as an
assumption of convenience--transport costs only for the differentiated
goods--matters a great deal. In a focal case in which differentiated and
homogeneous goods have identical transport costs, the home market effect
disappears. This paper discusses available evidence on the relative
trade costs for differentiated and homogeneous goods. No compelling
argument is found that market size will matter for industrial structure."
"12",NA,"8805","This paper studies endogenous world balanced-growth equilibria in which
national learning productivity differentials govern relative per capita
products. Learning productivities depend on the national share of world
specialized-goods production, national and world scale, and familiarity
with the foreign economy. Familiarity indexes the extent to which
imported specialized goods enhance learning productivity. The authors
find that mutual familiarization causes per capita products to converge.
Unfamiliar economies diverge substantially and persistently. Unilateral
familiarization of a less-developed country (LDC) with the leading
economy causes the LDC to catch up to, and even overtake, the leader."
"13",NA,"8805","This paper presents a simple R&D-driven endogenous growth model to shed
light on some puzzling economic trends. The model can account for why
patent statistics have been roughly constant even though R&D employment
has risen sharply over the last thirty years. The model also illuminates
why steadily increasing R&D effort has not led to any upward trend in
economic growth rates, as is predicted by earlier R&D-driven endogenous
growth models with the 'scale effect' property."
"14",NA,"8901","The authors analyze an economy that lacks a strong legal-political
institutional infrastructure and is populated by multiple powerful
groups. Powerful groups dynamically interact via a fiscal process that
effectively allows open access to the aggregate capital stock. In
equilibrium, this leads to slow economic growth and a 'voracity effect,'
by which a shock, such as a terms of trade windfall, perversely
generates a more-than-proportionate increase in fiscal redistribution
and reduces growth. The authors also show that a dilution in the
concentration of power leads to faster growth and a less procyclical
response to shocks."
"15",NA,"8901","Although microeconomic studies find a positive relationship between R&D
and skill premia, much of the recent rise in U.S. wage inequality was
accompanied by slowing labor-productivity growth and relatively slow
introduction of new technologies. These conflicting observations are
consistent with the effects of a skewed distribution of 'absorptive
capacities'--the rate at which technology-specific skills can be
acquired--in a model of endogenous technological change. The framework
is used to assess whether the productivity slowdown and the rise in wage
inequality can be jointly accounted for by the contemporaneous decline
in the growth rate of labor quality."
"16",NA,"8901","In skill-biased (deskilling) technological revolutions, learning
investments required by new machines are greater (smaller) than those
required by preexisting machines. Skill-biased (deskilling) revolutions
trigger reallocations of capital from slow- (fast-) to fast- (slow-)
learning workers, thereby reducing the relative and absolute wages of
the former. The model of skill-biased (deskilling) revolutions provides
insight into developments since the mid-1970s (in the 1910s). The
empirical work documents a large increase in the interindustry
dispersion of capital-labor ratios since 1975. Changes in industry
capital intensity are related to the skill composition of the labor
force."
"17",NA,"8901","The authors examine self-control problems--modeled as time-inconsistent,
present-biased preferences--in a model where a person must do an
activity exactly once. They emphasize two distinctions: do activities
involve immediate costs or immediate rewards, and are people
sophisticated or naive about future self-control problems? Naive people
procrastinate immediate-cost activities and preproperate--do too
soon--immediate-reward activities. Sophistication mitigates
procrastination but exacerbates preproperation. Moreover, with immediate
costs, a small present bias can severely harm only naive people, whereas
with immediate rewards it can severely harm only sophisticated people.
Lessons for savings, addiction, and elsewhere are discussed."
"18",NA,"8901","Recent articles have shown that contracts can support the efficient
outcome for bilateral trade even in the face of specific investments and
incomplete contracting. These studies typically considered 'selfish'
investments that benefit the investor (e.g., the seller's investment
reduces her production costs). The authors find very different results
for 'cooperative' investments that directly benefit the investor's
partner (e.g., the seller's investment improves the buyer's value of the
good). Most importantly, if committing not to renegotiate the contract
is impossible, then contracting has no value, i.e., the parties cannot
do better than to abandon contracting altogether in favor of ex post
negotiation."
"19",NA,"8901","This paper studies decisionmaking with rules of thumb in the context of
dynamic decision problems and compares it to dynamic programming. A rule
is a fixed mapping from a subset of states into actions. Rules are
compared by averaging over past experiences. This can lead to favoring
rules which are only applicable in good states. Correcting this good
state bias requires solving the dynamic program. The authors provide a
general framework and characterize the asymptotic properties. They apply
it to provide a candidate explanation for the sensitivity of consumption
to transitory income."
"20",NA,"8901","The authors model a war of attrition with N+K firms competing for N
prizes. In a 'natural oligopoly' context, the K - 1 lowest-value firms
drop out instantaneously, even though each firm's value is private
information to itself. In a 'standard setting' context, in which every
competitor suffers losses until a standard is chosen, even after giving
up on its own preferred alternative, each firm's exit time is
independent both of K and of other players' actions. The authors'
results explain how long it takes to form a winning coalition in
politics. Solving the model is facilitated by the revenue equivalence
theorem."
"21",NA,"8901","The World Trade Organization (WFO) lacks the power to directly enforce
agreements. It is, therefore, important to understand what role the WTO
can play to facilitate international cooperation and whether a
multilateral institution can offer distinct advantages over a web of
bilateral agreements. This paper examines two potential benefits of a
multilateral trade institution: first, verifying violations of the
agreements and informing third parties, thus facilitating multilateral
reputation mechanisms; second, promoting multilateral trade negotiations
rather than a web of bilateral negotiations. The model suggests that a
multilateral approach is particularly important when there are strong
imbalances in bilateral trading relationships."
"22",NA,"8901","The authors propose a unified theoretical framework within which to
interpret and evaluate the foundational principles of GATT. Working
within a general equilibrium trade model, they represent government
preferences in a way that is consistent with national income
maximization but also allows for the possibility of distributional
concerns as emphasized in leading political-economy models. Using this
general framework, the authors establish that GATT's principles of
reciprocity and nondiscrimination can be viewed as simple rules that
assist governments in their effort to implement efficient trade
agreements. From this perspective, the authors argue that preferential
agreements undermine GATT's ability to deliver efficient multilateral
outcomes."
"23",NA,"8901","The author estimate a decomposition of productivity and hours into
technology and nontechnology components. Two results stand out: (1) the
estimated conditional correlations of hours and productivity are
negative for technology shocks, positive for nontechnology shocks; and
(2) hours show a persistent decline in response to a positive technology
shock. Most of the results hold for a variety of model specifications
and for the majority of G7 countries. The picture that emerges is hard
to reconcile with a conventional real-business-cycle interpretation of
business cycles but is shown to be consistent with a simple model with
monopolistic competition and sticky prices."
"24",NA,"8901","Scale economies and agglomeration externalities are alleged to be
important determinants of economic growth. To assess these effects, the
authors outline and estimate a microfoundations model based on a dynamic
cost function specification. This model provides for the separate
identification of the impacts of externalities and cyclical utilization
on short- and long-run scale economies and input substitution patterns.
The authors find that scale economies are prevalent in U.S
manufacturing; cost savings and scale effects often attributed to
internal inputs may be due to external factors; and supply-side
agglomeration effects are greater than demand-side, especially in the
long run."
"25",NA,"8903","Examining the correlation between trade and income cannot identify the
direction of causation between the two. Countries' geographic
characteristics, however, have important effects on trade and are
plausibly uncorrelated with other determinants of income. This paper,
therefore, constructs measures of the geographic component of countries'
trade and uses those measures to obtain instrumental variables estimates
of the effect of trade on income. The results provide no evidence that
ordinary least-squares estimates overstate the effects of trade.
Further, they suggest that trade has a quantitatively large and robust,
though only moderately statistically significant, positive effect on
income."
"26",NA,"8903","The authors evaluate the voluntary export restraint that was initially
placed on exports of automobiles from Japan in 1981. They evaluate the
impact this policy had on U.S. consumer welfare, firm profits, and
foregone tariff revenue from its initiation through 1990."
"27",NA,"8903","This paper constructs a model of the transfer paradox for a small open
economy with nontraded goods. It demonstrates that increased production
of nontraded goods can change their domestic price so as to offset the
otherwise beneficial effect of aid and, under certain conditions, to
create a transfer paradox even in a small country. The model is
estimated with time-series data for 44 aid-dependent countries for the
period 1970-90. The results support the model and show that the
nontraded goods expansion effect is more likely to cause immiserization
than Harry G. Johnson's (1967) tariff-distorting export-displacement
effect."
"28",NA,"8903","This paper presents a dynamic general equilibrium model of R&D-based
trade between two structurally identical countries in which both
innovation and skill acquisition rates are endogenously determined.
Trade liberalization increases R&D investment and the rate of
technological change. It also reduces the relative wage of unskilled
workers and results in skill upgrading within each industry when R&D is
the skilled-labor intensive activity relative to manufacturing of final
products. Time-series evidence from the United States and simulation
analysis support the empirical relevance of the model, which offers a
North-North trade explanation for increasing wage inequality."
"29",NA,"8903","In the wake of the Mexican and Asian currency turmoil, the subject of
financial crises have come to the forefront of academic and policy
discussions. This paper analyzes the links between banking and currency
crises. The authors find that problems in the banking sector typically
precede a currency crisis--the currency crisis deepens the banking
crisis, activating a vicious spiral; financial liberalization often
precedes banking crises. The anatomy of these episodes suggests that
crises occur as the economy enters a recession, following a prolonged
boom in economic activity that was fueled by credit, capital inflows,
and accompanied by an overvalued currency."
"30",NA,"8903","Endorsements are a simple language for communication between interest
group leaders and group members. The members, who share policy concerns,
may not perfectly understand where their interests lie on certain
issues. If their leaders cannot fully explain the issues, they can
convey some information by endorsing a candidate or party. When interest
groups endorse legislative contenders, the candidates may compete for
backing. Policies may favor special interests at the expense of the
general public. The authors examine the conditions under which parties
compete for endorsements, the extent to which policy outcomes are
skewed, and the normative properties of the political equilibria."
"31",NA,"8903","Using state-by-state voting data for U.S. presidential elections, the
authors observe that voter turnout is a positive function of predicted
closeness. To explain the strategic component of political
participation, they develop a follow-the-leader model. Political leaders
expend effort according to their chance of being pivotal, which depends
on the expected closeness of the race (at both state and national
levels) and how voters respond to their effort. Structural estimation
supports this model. For example, a 1 percent increase in the predicted
closeness at the state level stimulates leaders' efforts, which
increases turnout by 0.34 percent."
"32",NA,"8903","The author develops a model in which a firm's only asset is its name,
which summarizes its reputation, and studies the forces that cause names
to be valuable, tradable assets. An adverse selection model in which
shifts of ownership are not observable guarantees an active market for
names with either finite or infinite horizons. No equilibrium exists in
which only good types buy good names. The reputational dynamics that
emerge from the model are more realistic than those in standard
game-theoretic reputation models and suggest that adverse selection
plays a crucial role in understanding firm reputation."
"33",NA,"8903","Recent developments in computer networks have driven the cost of
distributing information virtually to zero, creating extraordinary
opportunities for sharing product evaluations. The authors present
pricing and subsidy mechanisms that operate through a computerized
market and induce the efficient provision of evaluations. The mechanisms
overcome three major challenges: first, evaluations, which are public
goods, are likely to be underprovided; second, an inefficient ordering
of evaluators may arise; and third, the optimal quantity of evaluations
depends on what is learned from the initial evaluations."
"34",NA,"8903","Oligopoly models where prior actions by firms affect subsequent marginal
costs have been useful in illuminating policy debates in areas such as
antitrust regulation, environmental protection, and international
competition. The authors discuss properties of such models when a
Cournot equilibrium occurs at the second stage. Aggregate production
costs strictly decline with no change in gross revenue or gross consumer
surplus if the prior actions strictly increase the variance of marginal
costs without changing the marginal-cost sum. Therefore, unless the cost
of inducing second-stage asymmetry more than offsets this reduction in
production costs, the private and social optima are asymmetric."
"35",NA,"8903","Governments often promote inward foreign investment to encourage
technology 'spillovers' from foreign to domestic firms. Using panel data
on Venezuelan plants, the authors find that foreign equity participation
is positively correlated with plant productivity (the 'own-plant'
effect), but this relationship is only robust for small enterprises.
They then test for spillovers from joint ventures to plants with no
foreign investment. Foreign investment negatively affects the
productivity of domestically owned plants. The net impact of foreign
investment, taking into account these two offsetting effects, is quite
small. The gains from foreign investment appear to be entirely captured
by joint ventures."
"36",NA,"8903","Does the positive correlation between infrastructure and productivity
reflect causation? If so, in which direction? The author finds that,
when growth in roads (the largest component of infrastructure) changes,
productivity growth changes disproportionately in U.S. industries with
more vehicles. That vehicle-intensive industries benefit more from
road-building suggests that roads are productive. At the margin,
however, road investments do not appear unusually productive.
Intuitively, the interstate system was highly productive, but a second
one would not be. Road-building thus explains much of the productivity
slowdown through a one-time, unrepeatable productivity boost in the
1950s and 1960s."
"37",NA,"8904","Economists and psychologists argue that individuals skew personal
beliefs to accord with their own interests. To test for the presence of
self-serving beliefs, we surveyed 1,200 members of the Mormon Church
about tithing. A tithe is a voluntary contribution equal to 10 percent
of income. Since respondents must decide privately what income items to
tithe, we observe how the income definition depends on an individual's
religious and financial incentives. We find surprisingly little evidence
that an individual's financial situation influences beliefs about what
counts as income for the tithe. However, ambiguity increases the role
for self-serving biases."
"38",NA,"8904","In recent years workplace smoking policies have become increasingly
prevalent and restrictive. Using data from two large-scale national
surveys, we investigate whether these policies reduce smoking. Our
estimates suggest that workplace bans reduce smoking prevalence by 5
percentage points and daily consumption among smokers by 10 percent.
Although workers with better health habits are more likely to work at
firms with smoking bans, estimates from systems of equations indicate
that these results are not subject to an omitted variables bias. The
rapid increase in bans can explain all of the recent drop in smoking
among workers relative to nonworkers."
"39",NA,"8904","We report on the design of the new clearinghouse adopted by the National
Resident Matching Program, which annually fills approximately 20,000
jobs for new physicians. Because the market has complementarities
between applicants and between positions, the theory of simple matching
markets does not apply directly. However, computational experiments show
the theory provides good approximations. Furthermore, the set of stable
matchings, and the opportunities for strategic manipulation, are
surprisingly small. A new kind of ""core convergence"" result explains
this; that each applicant interviews only a small fraction of available
positions is important. We also describe engineering aspects of the
design process."
"40",NA,"8904","We examine strategic interactions between firms and planners in China,
comparing behavior between: (i) students and managers with field
experience with this situation, (ii) standard versus increased monetary
incentives, and (iii) sessions conducted ""in context,"" making explicit
reference to interactions between planners and managers, and those
without any such references. The dynamics of play are similar across
treatments with play only gradually, and incompletely, converging on a
pooling equilibrium. A fivefold increase in incentives significantly
increases initial levels of strategic play. Games played in context
generated greater levels of strategic play for managers, with minimal
impact on students."
"41",NA,"8904","This article presents an empirical study of market power in the British
electricity industry. Estimates of price-cost markups are derived using
direct measures of marginal cost and several approaches that do not rely
on cost data. Since two suppliers facing inelastic demand dominate the
industry, most oligopoly models predict prices substantially above
marginal costs. All estimates indicate that prices, while higher than
marginal costs, are not nearly as high as most theoretical models
predict. Regulatory constraints, the threat of entry, and financial
contracts between the suppliers and their customers are considered as
possible explanations for the observed price levels."
"42",NA,"8904","This paper uses direct evidence to evaluate whether asymmetric
information is a barrier to trade in the largest market for private
insurance in the world: life insurance. We report several findings that
seem difficult to reconcile with the conventional theory of insurance
under asymmetric information. We conjecture that sellers may know their
costs of production better than consumers in this market, as in those
for most other products."
"43",NA,"8904","This paper reports findings from an experiment that implements a
search-theoretic model of money as a medium of exchange. The question
examined is whether subjects learn to adopt the same commodities as
media of exchange that the model predicts will be used in equilibrium.
We report that subjects have a strong tendency to play ""fundamental""
rather than ""speculative"" strategies even in environments where
speculative strategies yield higher payoffs. We examine some possible
motivations for subjects' behavior and conclude that subjects are mainly
motivated by past payoff experience as opposed to the marketability
considerations that the theory emphasizes."
"44",NA,"8904","This paper studies a general-equilibrium model of a dynamic economy with
menu costs. Each firm's productivity is exposed to idiosyncratic and
aggregate productivity shocks around a trend, and the money supply to
monetary shocks around a trend. All consumption, pricing, and production
decisions are based on optimizing behavior. There exists a staggered
Markov perfect equilibrium with prices determined by a two-sided (s, S)
markup strategy. The paper analyzes the optimal markup strategy and
investigates the dynamics of the price index and the aggregate output.
The welfare consequences of the uncertain aggregate productivity and
money supply are also examined."
"45",NA,"8904","Empirical research on the permanent-income hypothesis (PIH) has found
that consumption growth is excessively sensitive to predictable changes
in income. This finding is interpreted as strong evidence against the
PIH. We propose an explanation for apparent excess sensitivity that is
based on a quantitative equilibrium model of household production in
which permanent-income consumers respond to shifts in sectoral wages and
prices by substituting work effort and consumption across home and
market sectors. Although the PIH is true, this mechanism generates
apparent excess sensitivity because market consumption responds to
predictable income growth."
"46",NA,"8904","This paper explores investment fluctuations due to discrete changes in a
plant's capital stock. The resulting aggregate investment dynamics are
surprisingly rich, reflecting the interaction between a replacement
cycle, the cross-sectional distribution of the age of the capital stock,
and an aggregate shock. Using plant-level data, lumpy investment is
procyclical and more likely for older capital. Further, the predicted
path of aggregate investment that neglects vintage effects tracks actual
aggregate investment reasonably well. However, ignoring fluctuations in
the cross-sectional distribution of investment vintages can yield
predictable nontrivial errors in forecasting changes in aggregate
investment."
"47",NA,"8905","William Vickrey's predicted equivalences between first-price sealed-bid
and Dutch auctions, and between second-price sealed-bid and English
auctions, are tested using field experiments that auctioned off
collectible trading cards over the Internet. The results indicate that
the Dutch auction produces 30-percent higher revenues than the
first-price auction format, a violation of the theoretical prediction
and a reversal of previous laboratory results, and that the English and
second-price formats produce roughly equivalent revenues."
"48",NA,"8905","The 44 Liquormart decision, eliminating Rhode Island's ban on liquor
price advertising, made Rhode Island the subject of a natural experiment
for measuring the effect of advertising on prices. Using Massachusetts
prices as controls, we find that advertising stores substantially cut
only prices of the products that they advertise. Prices of other
products, at both advertising and nonadvertising stores, do not change.
Advertising stores cut their prices on products advertised by rivals,
while nonadvertising stores do not. We find no reductions in price
dispersion across stores. Newspaper-advertising stores appear to draw a
higher share of customers after they advertise."
"49",NA,"8905","We present a dynamic model of adverse selection to examine the
interactions between new and used goods markets. We find that the used
market never shuts down, the volume of trade can be large, and
distortions are lower than previously thought. New cars prices can be
higher under adverse selection than in its absence. An extension to
several brands that differ in reliability leads to testable predictions
of the effects of adverse selection. Unreliable brands have steeper
price declines and lower volumes of trade. We contrast these predictions
with those of a model where brands physically depreciate at different
rates."
"50",NA,"8905","This paper provides a theory of lobby formation within a framework in
which trade policy is determined through political contributions. Under
certain conditions, free trade turns out to be an equilibrium outcome
either when the government has a high affinity for political
contributions or when it cares a great deal about social welfare.
Moreover, greater inequality in asset distribution results in a greater
number of lobbies and, in most cases, more protection for each of these
lobbies. Furthermore, industries with higher levels of capital stock,
fewer capitalists, more inelastic demand, and smaller geographical
dispersion are the ones that get organized."
"51",NA,"8905","The Grossman-Helpman ""Protection for Sale"" model, concerning the
political economy of trade protection, yields clear predictions for the
cross-sectional structure of import barriers. Our objective is to check
whether the predictions of the Grossman-Helpman model are consistent
with the data and, if the model finds support, to estimate its key
structural parameters. We find that the pattern of protection in the
United States in 1983 is broadly consistent with the predictions of the
model. A surprising finding is that the weight of welfare in the
government's objective function is many times larger than the weight of
contributions."
"52",NA,"8905","We study a dynamic version of Meltzer and Richard's median-voter model
of the size of government. Taxes are proportional to total income, and
they are redistributed as equal lump-sum transfers. Voting takes place
periodically over time, and each consumer votes for the tax rate that
maximizes his equilibrium utility. We calibrate the model to U.S. data.
Key elements in the calibration are the income and wealth distribution
and the parameters governing the leisure and consumption choices. The
total size of transfers predicted by our political-economy model is
quite close to the size of transfers in the data."
"53",NA,"8905","Theories of organization of legislatures have mainly focused on the U.S.
Congress, explaining why committee systems emerge there, but not
explaining variance in organization across legislatures of different
countries. To analyze the effects of different constitutional features
on the internal organization of legislatures, we adopt a vote-buying
model and consider the incentives to delegate decision rights in a game
among legislative chambers. We show how presidential veto power and
bicameral separation can encourage a legislative chamber to create
internal veto players or supermajority rules, while a unicameral
structure can encourage legislators to delegate power to a leader."
"54",NA,"8905","In this paper we study the quantitative impact of marginal tax rates on
the distribution of income. Our methodology builds on computable
general-equilibrium framework. We find that distortions from marginal
tax rate changes of the sort implied by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 have
sizable effects on income inequality in a reasonably quantified
life-cycle setting: In our model rate changes alone capture half the
increase in the pretax Gini that actually occurred between 1984 and
1989."
"55",NA,"8905","Our thesis is that poor countries are poor because they employ
arrangements for which the equilibrium outcomes are characterized by
inferior technologies being used, and being used inefficiently. In this
paper, we analyze the consequences of one such arrangement. In each
industry, the arrangement enables a coalition of factor suppliers to be
the monopoly seller of its input services to all firms using a
particular production process. We find that eliminating this monopoly
arrangement could well increase output by roughly a factor of 3 without
any increase in inputs."
"56",NA,"8905","Theory restricts short-run job creation and destruction responses and
cumulative employment and job reallocation responses to allocative and
aggregate shocks. We formulate these restrictions and implement them for
postwar data on U.S. manufacturing. Allocative shocks are the main
driving force behind cyclical movements in job reallocation, but their
contribution to employment fluctuations varies greatly across
alternative identification assumptions. Also, the data compel one or
both of the following inferences: aggregate shocks greatly alter the
shape and not just the mean of the cross-sectional density of employment
growth rates; allocative shocks cause short-run reductions in aggregate
employment."
"57",NA,"8905","I present a model where firms decide what types of jobs to create and
then search for suitable workers. When there are few skilled workers and
the skilled-unskilled productivity gap is small, firms create a single
type of job and recruit all workers. An increase in the proportion of
skilled workers or skill-biased technical change can create a
qualitative change in the composition of jobs, increasing the demand for

conventional wisdom holds that a firm would always upgrade them
simultaneously. We show, however, that if upgrading each input involves
a fixed cost, the firm may upgrade them at different dates,
""asynchronously."" This insight helps us understand why productivity
rises with the age of a plant, why investment in structures is more
spiked than equipment investment, and why plants have spare capacity.
The bigger point of the paper is that complementarity does not
necessarily imply comovement--not even for a single decision maker."
"59",NA,"9001","The Japanese banking crisis provides a natural experiment to test
whether a loan supply shock can affect real economic activity. Because
the shock was external to U.S. credit markets, yet connected through the
Japanese bank penetration of U.S. markets, this event allows us to
identify an exogenous loan supply shock and ultimately link that shock
to construction activity in U.S. commercial real estate markets. We
exploit the variation across geographically distinct commercial real

emanating from Japan had real effects on economic activity in the United

"60",NA,"9001","We consider a market with ""red"" and ""green"" workers, where labels are
payoff irrelevant. Workers may acquire skills. Skilled workers search
for vacancies, while firms search for workers. A unique symmetric
equilibrium exists in which color is irrelevant. There are also
asymmetric equilibria in which firms search only for green workers, more
green than red workers acquire skills, skilled green workers receive
higher wages, and the unemployment rate is higher among skilled red
workers. Discrimination between ex ante identical individuals arises in
equilibrium, and yet firms have perfect information about their workers,
and strictly prefer to hire minority workers."
"61",NA,"9001","This paper presents a general-equilibrium model where human capital
investment increases specialization and exposes skilled workers to
region-specific earnings risk Interjurisdictional mobility of skilled
labor mitigates these risks; state-contingent migration of skilled labor
also improves efficiency. With perfect capital markets, labor-market
integration raises welfare and reduces ex post earnings inequality. If
instead human capital investment can only be financed through local
taxes, labor-market integration leads to interjurisdictional fiscal
competition, shifting the burden of taxation to low-skilled immobile
workers. Decentralized public provision of human capital investment
creates earnings inequalities and is inefficient."
"62",NA,"9001","This paper develops a theory of inequality and the social contract
aiming to explain how countries with similar economic and political
""fundamentals"" can sustain such different systems of social insurance,
fiscal redistribution, and education finance as those, of the United
States and Western Europe. With imperfect credit and insurance markets
some redistributive policies can improve ex ante welfare, and this
implies that their political support tends to decrease with inequality.
Conversely, with credit constraints, lower redistribution translates
into more persistent inequality; hence the potential for multiple steady
states, with mutually reinforcing high inequality and low
redistribution, or vice versa."
"63",NA,"9001","This paper uses general-equilibrium simulations to explore the role of
residential mobility in shaping the impact of different private-school

New York data) with housing stocks that vary within and across
districts. In this model, it is demonstrated that school-district
targeted vouchers are similar in their impact to non targeted vouchers
but vastly different from vouchers targeted to low-income households.
Furthermore, strong migration effects are shown to significantly improve
the likely equity consequences of voucher programs."
"64",NA,"9001","In a dynamic model of moral hazard, competition can undermine prudent
bank behavior. While capital-requirement regulation can induce prudent
behavior, the policy yields Pareto-inefficient outcomes. Capital
requirements reduce gambling incentives by putting bank equity at risk.
However, they also have a perverse effect of harming banks' franchise
values, thus encouraging gambling. Pareto-efficient outcomes can be
achieved by adding deposit-rate controls as a regulatory instrument,
since they facilitate prudent investment by increasing franchise values.
Even if deposit-rate ceilings are not binding on the equilibrium path,
they may be useful in deterring gambling off the equilibrium path."

all corruption is excessively costly, second-best intervention may
involve a certain fraction of bureaucrats accepting bribes. When
corruption is harder to prevent, there may be both more bureaucrats and
higher public-sector wages. Also, the optimal degree of government

storable goods. Anticipated future scarcity of these resources will
increase current prices and poaching. This implies that, for given
initial conditions, there may be rational expectations equilibria
leading to both extinction and survival. The cheapest way for
governments to eliminate extinction equilibria may be to commit to tough
antipoaching measures if the population falls below a threshold. For
governments without credibility, the cheapest way to eliminate
extinction equilibria may be to accumulate a sufficient stockpile of the
storable good and threaten to sell it should the population fall."
"68",NA,"9003","Saving and growth are strongly positively correlated across countries.
Recent empirical evidence suggests that this correlation holds largely
because high growth leads to high saving, not the other way around. This
evidence is difficult to reconcile with standard growth models, since
forward-looking consumers with standard utility should save less in a
fast-growing economy because they know they will be richer in the future
than they are today. We show that if utility depends partly on how
consumption compares to a ""habit stock"" determined by past consumption,
an otherwise-standard growth model can imply that increases in growth
can cause increased saving."
"69",NA,"9003","This paper examines the role for tax policies in productivity-shock
driven economies with catching-up-with-the-Joneses utility functions.
The optimal tax policy is shown to affect the economy countercyclically

taxes when it is ""overheating"" in booms and ""stimulating"" the economy
with lower taxes in recessions to keep consumption up. Thus, models with
catching-up-with-the-Joneses utility functions call for traditional
Keynesian demand-management policies but for rather unorthodox reasons."
"70",NA,"9003","This paper explores a monetary-policy model with habit formation for
consumers, in which consumers' utility depends in part on current
consumption relative to past consumption. The empirical tests developed
in the paper show that one can reject the hypothesis of no habit
formation with tremendous confidence, largely because the
habit-formation model captures the gradual hump-shaped response of real
spending to various shocks. The paper then embeds the habit-consumption
specification in a monetary-policy model and finds that the responses of
both spending and inflation to monetary-policy actions are significantly
improved by this modification."
"71",NA,"9003","This paper tests for the presence of habit formation using household
data. A simple model of habit formation implies a condition relating the
strength of habits to the evolution of consumption over time. When the

on Income Dynamics (PSID), the results yield no evidence of habit
formation at the annual frequency. This finding is robust to a number of
changes in the specification. It also holds for several proxies for
nondurables and services consumption created by combining PSID variables
with weights estimated from Consumer Expenditure Survey data."
"72",NA,"9003","We study the monetary-transmission mechanism with a data set that
includes quarterly observations of every insured U.S. commercial bank
from 1976 to 1993. We find that the impact of monetary policy on lending
is stronger for banks with less liquid balance sheets--i.e., banks with
lower ratios of securities to assets. Moreover, this pattern is largely
attributable to the smaller banks, those in the bottom 95 percent of the
size distribution. Our results support the existence of a ""bank lending
channel"" of monetary transmission, though they do not allow us to make
precise statements about its quantitative importance."
"73",NA,"9003","This paper tests for the existence of asymmetric information between the
Federal Reserve and the public by examining Federal Reserve and

provide signals of the Federal Reserve's information and that commercial
forecasters modify their forecasts in response to those signals. These
findings may explain why long-term interest rates typically rise in
response to shifts to tighter monetary policy."
"74",NA,"9003","The countercyclical pattern of inventory-sales ratios is a striking
feature of inventory behavior. In a model where inventories are
productive for sales, both the markup of price over marginal cost and
expected changes in marginal cost are key determinants of that ratio.

to countercyclical markups in production-to-stock manufacturing
industries. Time markup turns out to be more important than
intertemporal substitution in explaining the behavior of inventory-sales
ratios."
"75",NA,"9003","This paper considers propagation of aggregate shocks in a dynamic
general-equilibrium model with labor-market matching and endogenous job
destruction. Cyclical fluctuations in the job-destruction rate magnify
the output effects of shocks, as well as making them much more

job-destruction rate play an important role in generating persistence.
Propagation effects are shown to be quantitatively substantial when the
model is calibrated using job-flow data. incorporating costly capital
adjustment leads to significantly greater propagation."
"76",NA,"9003","The tension between allocative efficiency and information aggregation is
explored in the context of an auction: k identical objects of unknown

valuation of an object of given quality. Bidders receive a signal about
the quality of the objects. The k highest bidders get an object and pay
a price equal to the k + first highest bid. We find conditions under
which, in the limit, objects are allocated efficiently to those with the
highest tastes, and price converges in probability to the value of an
object to the marginal taste type."
"77",NA,"9003","The effect of insecure ownership on ordinary investment and natural
resource use is examined. Insecure ownership is postulated to depend on
the type of government regime in power and the prevalence of political
violence or instability. The political determinants of economy-wide

used to form an index of ownership security. When introduced into
empirical models of natural resource use, this index has a significant
and quantitatively important effect on the use of forests and petroleum.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, ownership risk slows resource use in
some circumstances."
"78",NA,"9003","This paper presents a dynamic model, inspired by evolutionary game
theory, of how standards and norms emerge in decentralized economies. It
shows that standardization outcomes depend on adopters' attitudes to

incompatibility, standardization never fails to happen eventually, but
societies sometimes end up picking inferior standards. In this case,
official action can be useful to quickly achieve sensible
standardization. On the other hand, when individuals display tolerance
or neutrality to incompatibility, there is neither path-dependency nor a
lock-in problem, and regulation seems a poor alternative to
laissez-faire."
"79",NA,"9004","A change in the audition procedures of symphony orchestras--adoption of

actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that
the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired.
Although some of our estimates have large standard errors and there is
one persistent effect in the opposite direction, the weight of the
evidence suggests that the blind audition procedure fostered
impartiality in hiring and increased the proportion women in symphony

affected by borders, geography, and demographics. I find that even
though a large wage differential exists between them, the labor markets
of the United States and Mexico are closely integrated. Mexico's border
region is more integrated with the United States than is the Mexican
interior. Evidence of integration precedes the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and may be largely the result of migration."
"81",NA,"9004","We study how diversity evolves at a firm with entry-level and
upper-level employees who vary in ability and ""type"" (gender or

this bias may favor either the minority or the majority. We characterize
possible steady states, including a ""glass ceiling,"" where the upper

multiple steady states, whereby temporary affirmative-action policies

"83",NA,"9004","This paper develops a unified growth model that captures the historical
evolution of population, technology, and output. It encompasses the
endogenous transition between three regimes that have characterized
economic development. The economy evolves from a Malthusian regime,
where technological progress is slow and population growth prevents any
sustained rise in income per capita, into a Post-Malthusian regime,
where technological progress rises and population growth absorbs only
part of output growth. Ultimately, a demographic transition reverses the
positive relationship between income and population growth, and the
economy enters a Modern Growth regime, with reduced population growth
and sustained income growth."
"84",NA,"9004","A multicountry Schumpeterian growth model is constructed. Because of
technology transfer, R&D-performing countries converge to parallel
growth paths; other countries stagnate. A parameter change that would
have raised a country's growth rate in standard Schumpetarian theory
will permanently raise its productivity and per capita income relative
to other countries and raise the world growth rate. Transitional
dynamics are analyzed for each country and for the world economy.
Steady-state income differences obey the same equation as in
neoclassical theory, but since R&D is positively correlated with
investment rates, capital accumulation accounts for less than estimated
by neoclassical theory."
"85",NA,"9004","This paper uses a new database on foreign aid to examine the
relationships among foreign aid, economic policies, and growth per

developing countries with good fiscal, monetary, and trade policies but
has little effect in the presence of poor policies. Good policies are
ones that are themselves important for growth. The quality of policy has
only a small impact on the allocation of aid. Our results suggest that
aid would be more effective if it were more systematically conditioned
on good policy."
"86",NA,"9004","This paper challenges the current belief that income inequality has a
negative relationship with economic growth. It uses an improved data set
on income inequality, which not only reduces measurement error, but also
allows estimation via a panel technique. Panel estimation makes it
possible to control for time-invariant country-specific effects,
therefore eliminating a potential source of omitted-variable bias.
Results suggest that in the short and medium term, an increase in a
country's level of income inequality has a significant positive
relationship with subsequent economic growth. This relationship is
highly robust across samples, variable definitions, and model
specifications."
"87",NA,"9004","We develop a model where the allocation of human resources,
intergenerational social mobility, and technological growth are jointly
determined. High growth endogenously increases the equilibrium return to
innate cognitive ability and makes the allocation of individuals depend
more on innate ability and less on social background. Individuals with a
higher level of innate cognitive ability can deal better with less
known, bur more productive, technologies and thus choose a higher rate
of technological growth. A social allocation based on innate ability and
high growth will thus reinforce each other, implying the possibility of
multiple endogenous growth equilibrium."
"88",NA,"9004","This paper introduces various sources of consumer heterogeneity in
one-sector representative consumer (RC) growth models and develops tools
to study the evolution of the distribution of consumptions, assets, and

optimal savings and the Arrow-Romer model of productive spillovers. The
RC property per se places very few restrictions on the nature of
observed distributions, and a wide range of distributive dynamics and
income mobility patterns can arise as the equilibrium outcome. An
example illustrates how to use these tools to generate quantitative
predictions and compare them to the data."
"89",NA,"9004","We study a collective decision-making process in which people interested
in an issue may participate, at a cost, in a meeting, and the resulting
decision is a compromise among the participants' preferences. We show
that the equilibrium number of participants is small and their positions

likely to be random. The model and its equilibria are consistent with
evidence on the procedures and outcomes of U.S. regulatory hearings."
"90",NA,"9004","We examine how owners of productive resources (e.g. public enterprises
or financial capital) optimally allocate their resources among
wealth-constrained operators of unknown ability. Optimal allocations
exhibit: (1) shared enterprise profit--the resource owner always shares
the operator's profit; (2) dispersed enterprise ownership--resources are
widely distributed among operators of varying ability; (3) limited
benefits of competition--the owner may not benefit from increased
competition for the resource; and, sometimes (4) diluted incentives for
the most capable--more capable operators receive smaller shares of the
returns they generate. Implications for privatizations and venture
capital arrangements are explored."
"91",NA,"9005","This paper develops a simple general-equilibrium framework to study the
effect of the exchange-rate system on trade and welfare. An important
feature of the model is deviations from purchasing-power parity, caused
by rigid price setting in buyers' currency. In a benchmark model with
separable preferences and only monetary shocks, trade is unaffected by
the exchange-rate system, consistent with most evidence. In general,
both trade and welfare can be higher under either exchange-rate system,
depending on preferences and on the monetary-policy rules followed under
each system. There is no one-to-one relationship between the levels of
trade and welfare across exchange-rate systems."

by their place of origin in Ireland, and where they lived in New York.
During both panics this social network turns out to be the prime

"95",NA,"9005","A number of economists find that growth and schooling are highly
correlated across countries. A model is examined in which the ability to
build on the human capital of one's elders plays an important role in
linking growth to schooling. The model is calibrated to quantify the
strength of the effect of schooling on growth by using evidence from the
labor literature on Mincerian returns to education. The upshot is that
the impact of schooling on growth explains less than one-third of the

Asian countries are excluded; and, finally, home-country quality
differences of immigrants are directly related to U.S. earnings if the
immigrants are educated in their own country but not in the United

through its effect on household sorting. This finding may be explained
by another finding: students are equally segregated by school in
metropolitan areas with greater and lesser degrees of Tiebout choice

systems"" or ""industrial cultures"" in ex ante identical countries.
International openness thickens the market, facilitating leaner, less

which this microeconomic asymmetry is preserved in the aggregate and
show that it can account for much of the observed asymmetries in gross
job flows. This is so even though we abstract from job matching

diversification. We show that some investors follow the ""1/n strategy"":
they divide their contributions evenly across the funds offered in the

wisdom. As risk aversion increases, the myopic component of risky asset
demand disappears but the intertemporal hedging component does not.
Conservative investors hold assets to hedge the risk that real interest
rates will decline. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds are most suitable
for this purpose, but nominal bonds may also be used if inflation risk

substantially, by about 50 cents per capita."

addition, its business-cycle implications represent a substantial
improvement over the standard model. It accounts for persistence in
output, comovement of employment across different sectors over the

contrary to what is commonly believed, active monetary policy gives rise

Portugal. High employment protection makes economies more sclerotic; but
because it affects unemployment duration and worker flows in opposite

the new technology after the mid-1980s. Investors foresaw this in the

of the asset market by examining patterns of asset allocations and
prices in commercial aircraft markets. The empirical analysis indicates
that assets with a thinner market are less liquid -- i.e., more

shocks. Hence, when markets for assets are thin, firms' average
productivity and capacity utilization are lower, and the dispersions
of productivity and of capacity utilization are higher. In turn, prices
of assets with a thin market are lower and have a higher dispersion.

This central role of firms for high-skilled immigration suggests the traditional lens for evaluating the impact of immigration on natives through local area labor markets or national age-education approaches may miss important dynamics. We analyze the employment and wage trajectories of high-skilled workers born in America when a high-skilled immigrant arrives at their work site. We use linked employer-employee data during the 1995-2008 period from the Census Bureau for this exercise, which identifies the immigration status and country-of-birth of workers. We follow the subsequent career path of workers after high-skilled immigration occurs to the employee's work site both within firms (e.g., changes in employee salary, relocation to other sites) and across firms (e.g., movements to new jobs or out of workforce, long-term salary adjustments). The richness and depth of the Census Bureau data allow for multiple comparison points: selection on observables (e.g., age, tenure, salary levels and recent growth), varying immigration treatments across different work sites for the same firm for otherwise comparable employees, and (for a subset of cases and short time period at the end of our sample) randomization in H-1B admission lotteries."

Much of overall wage inequality arises within sector-occupations and for workers with similar observable characteristics.

I discuss three ways in which behavioral economics can contribute to public policy: by offering new policy tools, improving predictions about the effects of existing policies, and generating new welfare implications. I illustrate these contributions using applications to retirement savings, labor supply, and neighborhood choice. Behavioral models provide new tools to change behaviors such as savings rates and new counterfactuals to estimate the effects of policies such as income taxation. Behavioral models also provide new prescriptions for optimal policy that can be characterized in a non-paternalistic manner using methods analogous to those in neoclassical models. Model uncertainty does not justify using the neoclassical model; instead, it can provide a new rationale for using behavioral nudges. I conclude that incorporating behavioral features to the extent they help answer core economic questions may be more productive than viewing behavioral economics as a separate subfield that challenges the assumptions of neoclassical models."

While the dual estimates of TFPG for Korea and Hong Kong are similar to the primal estimates, they exceed the primal estimates by 1 percent a year for Taiwan and by more than 2 percent for Singapore. The reason for the large discrepancy for Singapore is because the return to capital has remained constant, despite the high rate of capital accumulation indicated by Singapore's national accounts. This discrepancy is not explained by financial market controls, capital income taxes, risk premium changes, and public investment subsidies. (JEL O11, O16, O47, O53) "

In others, the model has generically essentially unique mixed-strategy sequential equilibria, in which rational players' strategies protect all players from exploitation. "

In recessions, unemployment rises, and job vacancies fall. The natural explanation is an economywide fall in labor demand. But a compelling model that generates a fall in labor demand without a counterfactual fall in productivity has eluded theorists to date.

The reality is that contemporary political science is a net importer of ideas and methods from other disciplines, and from none more than economics. Indeed, some of the most exciting research in political science in the past 40 years has involved the incorporation of ideas from economics. We have neither the space nor the mandate to summarize that research here, but refer interested readers to Gary J. Miller's (1997) extensive review. Our aim here is to offertwo modest case studies of specific instances of overlap between the interests and research efforts of economists and political scientists. Our first case study focuses on describing and explaining participation in the workforce, the polity, and many other social activities and organizations. Our second case study focuses on the impact of political processes and institutions on macroeconomic policies and performance. In both these instances the work of economists has been quite fruitful&mdash;but also, we think, hampered by a characteristic overreliance on standard economic models and methods. However, in both areas, recent developments may point the way toward a more constructive research style combining the theoretical and empirical rigor of economics with a broader and more eclectic approach familiar to political scientists.

I found this list quite startling, because I had been professionally trained as a psychologist not to believe a word of it. The gap between the assumptions of our disciplines appeared very large indeed. Has the gap been narrowed in the intervening 30 years? A search through some introductory textbooks in economics indicates that if there has been any change, it has not yet filtered down to that level: the same assumptions are still in place as the cornerstones of economic analysis. However, a behavioral approach to economics has emerged in which the assumptions are not held sacrosanct. In the following I comment selectively on the developments with regard to the three assumptions, on both sides of the disciplinary divide. "

The present paper focuses on crossgame learning (the ability of subjects to take what has been learned in one game and generalize it to related games), an issue that has been ignored in most of the learning literature. We begin by laying out the basic experimental design and recapitulating early results characterizing the learning process. We then report results from an initial experiment in which we find a surprising degree of positive cross-game learning, contrary to the predictions of commonly employed learning models and to the findings of cognitive psychologists. We next explore two features of the environment that help to explain when and why this positive transfer occurs. First, we examine the effects of abstract versus meaningful context, an issue that has been largely ignored by economists out of the belief that behavior is largely dictated by the deep mathematical structure of a game. In contrast, results from cognitive psychology suggest that behavior may well be sensitive to context employed. Our results show that the use of meaningful context serves as a catalyst for positive transfer. Second, we explore how play by two-person teams differs from play by individuals. The psychology literature is quite pessimistic about the ability of teams to beat a ""truth wins"" standard based on performance of individuals. But teams easily surpass this norm in our cross-game experiment. We use the dialogues between team members to gain insight into how this transfer occurs, gaining direct confirmation for hypotheses generated by econometric analysis of earlier data. "

A radical discontinuity separates thousands of years of by and large stagnant living standards from the industrial era. Increasingly in the last few years, models have attempted to capture these long-run dynamics to try to explain how the world changed from a state where growth was fleeting and limited to one where it has become permanent and decisive. At the same time, economic historians have re-evaluated changes in living standards during the British Industrial Revolution (the canonical case). The new picture that emerges has become increasingly consistent over the last decade, and it differs drastically from earlier descriptions.

This has generated an international wave of social-security reforms over the last two decades, prompting more than 20 countries to establish Individual Account (IA) plans. In the United States, the idea of Individual Accounts has attracted recent interest with the release of the Final Report of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS): here, voluntary individual accounts were proposed as a key element of a reformed national old-age system (see Commission to Strengthen Social Security, 2001; John F. Cogan and Mitchell, 2003). Strengths of IA's include the fact that participants gain ownership in their accounts and diversify their pension investments; nevertheless, IA participants also must bear capital-market risk. Recent market volatility has reminded investors of the importance of capital-market fluctuations and their potential impact on retirement income. In response, some policymakers have suggested that ""guarantees"" be designed to help protect IA investments. Abroad, such guarantees have been adopted in several Latin American countries undergoing reform, and most recently, in Japan and Germany (Mitchell and Kent Smetters, 2003). Sensible public policy recommending the adoption of guarantees must identify their costs and who will pay for them. In this paper, we discuss how to evaluate such costs in the context of a social-security reform that includes IA's, along with ways to finance them. "

This trend has generated a growing debate on the appropriate monetary-policy rule for ""financially fragile"" economies with thin and incomplete financial markets that are subject to highly volatile capital flows. Within this context, I examine the implications of alternative monetary-policy rules and the choice of instruments and targets in a small open economy with imperfect capital markets. I compare a benchmark efficient-markets model with a monetary-targeting regime and three different inflation-targeting rules: the Taylor rule, a CPI inflation-target rule, and a non-tradable inflation-target rule. Furthermore, I study how sensitive the results are to varying degrees of capital-market integration. In addressing this question of the ""second best"" policy, the paper resembles that of Michael Devereaux and Phillip Lane (2001), who study the role of financial accelerator effects on various monetary-policy rules. I adopt a small open-economy setup rather than a two-country framework. In contrast to most small open-economy models, however, this paper does not assume a zero current-account balance. Net foreign-asset holdings and capital flows affect real volatility through the interest-rate risk premium. Given the significant role the risk premium plays in the external borrowing costs for emerging markets, this channel may have important consequences for economic dynamics. "

This increase is likely to spur efforts to cover the uninsured through legislative action. Given the failure of the most recent attempt at massive insurance expansions (David Cutler and Gruber, 2002), the likely approach is through incremental reforms. At the same time, there remains a fundamental conflict between the right and the left over the appropriate form that such incremental reforms should take. The left advocates additional expansions of the public-insurance safety net, for example, to parents of children already publicly insured. The right advocates subsidizing the purchase of private insurance through the tax code. In recent years, a number of analyses, both inside and outside of government, have studied the impact of these types of reforms (e.g., John Holahan et al., 1999; Gruber and Larry Levitt, 2000; Mark McClellan, 2000). These analyses have largely talked past each other, however, as there is little agreement on the ""right"" criteria on which to evaluate incremental reforms. Should we be concerned solely with the number of persons newly insured? What about the extent of displacement of other forms of insurance coverage, or ""crowdout""? And what about the types of uninsured covered; should we count equally a low-cost child who is newly insured and a high-cost older person? In this paper, I lay out the issues surrounding the criteria along which alternative approaches to reform can be evaluated. I then present microsimulation estimates of the impacts of three types of reforms: tax credits for individual purchase of nongroup insurance, expansions of public insurance to children and parents, and expansion of public insurance to all adults. I use the results from these simulations to contrast these reforms using the various criteria developed here. "

Coverage-expansion proposals without mandates, by far the most common since the defeat of the Clinton plan, must address risk-pooling realities in private markets. Insurers have strong financial incentives to segment risks and minimize pooling of heterogeneous risks, and narrow risk-pooling will diminish the adequacy of premium subsidies based on income alone, at least for higher-risk individuals. The current debate over flat tax credits and the non-group market is a case in point (Blumberg, 2001; Center for Studying Health System Change, 2002; Jack Hadley and James D. Reschovsky, 2002). We, along with nine other teams, were asked to develop a proposal that would expand coverage in a large and creative way (see Holahan et al., 2001).

"1519","10.1257/000282803321947209","9302","At least 41 million Americans are currently without health insurance in any given month (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002). They are uninsured for a variety of reasons, and most people who lack coverage are affected by more than one reason. Two generalizations can be made, however. First, a majority simply cannot afford to purchase health insurance unless it is heavily subsidized. Most do not have access to employer-sponsored coverage and so must purchase any insurance in the non-group (individual) health-insurance market - a market where, as I explain below, insurance is typically twice as expensive as employer-group coverage if it is not denied outright. Since about two-thirds of the uninsured have incomes below $35,000, non-group health-insurance premiums often exceed 10 percent of their incomes. The second generalization is that, to an important extent, high premiums in the non-group market and denial of coverage reflect market failure due to asymmetric information. Insurers can never know as much as an individual does about his or her health, family history of health problems, and tendency to seek medical care. Because of this asymmetry, it is impossible for an insurer to set premiums that accurately reflect the non-random portion of health-care costs for different individuals. The non-group market is the only health-insurance option for people without employersponsored coverage. Tax-related subsidies as proposed by members of Congress and the Bush administration do not address the market-failure problems and so are unlikely to make insurance much more affordable. To increase access to health insurance, risk in the non-group market needs to be shifted to a broader population base. In what follows, I first describe the three distinct health-insurance markets in which people can obtain health insurance, and the special nature of competition among insurance companies in the non-group market. Then I make the case for government to act as reinsurer and assume the risk of extremely high-cost people. Efficiency in the non-group health-insurance market would be improved if the government reinsured the market. Equity also would be increased if the government acted as reinsurer because more uninsured people would have access to insurance. Finally, I describe precedents for this role for government in other markets, and why tax-related subsidies will not succeed in increasing health-insurance coverage unless the risks of extremely high costs are shifted to the government.

My view is that what I call reward bias (unfair treatment of persons in formal economic transactions based on racial identity) is now a less significant barrier to the full participation by African-Americans in U.S. society than is what I will call development bias (blocked access to resources critical for personal development but available only via non-market-mediated social transactions). By making these points in the specific cultural and historical context of the black experience in U.S. society, I hope to contribute to a deeper conceptualization of the worldwide problem of race and economic marginality.

With hidden information, it may be optimal for an agent to supply the same inefficient effort regardless of cost conditions. With moral hazard, optimal contracts involve just two levels of compensation.

The paper develops a multisector model where inventories are held to avoid stockouts, and price markups vary along the business cycle. The omission of countercyclical markup variations from inventory targets introduces a downward bias in estimates of adjustment speeds obtained from partial adjustment models. When the cyclicality of markups differs across sectors, this downward bias is shown to be more severe with aggregate rather than firm-level data. Similar results apply not only to inventories, but also to labor and prices. Montercarlo simulations of a calibrated version of the model suggest that these biases are quantitatively significant. "

In the paper, the optimal monetary policy maximizes the expected utility of a representative household without having to rely on a set of linearly approximated equilibrium conditions, given the distortions associated with the staggered price-setting. It shows that the complete stabilization of the price level is optimal in the absence of initial price dispersion, while optimal inflation targets respond to changes in the level of relative price distortion in the presence of initial price dispersion.

"1667","10.1257/0002828053828473","9501","Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds at a zero short-term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective for achieving macroeconomic stabilization goals. We show that even were this the case, there remains a powerful argument for large-scale open market operations as a fiscal policy tool. As we also demonstrate, however, this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will be beneficial for stabilization as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired in a liquidity trap for some time. Thus, the microeconomic fiscal benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with standard macroeconomic objectives. Motivated by Japan's recent economic experience, we use a dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of open-market operations for an economy in Japan's predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a substantial welfare improvement through large open-market purchases of domestic government debt. "

We find that a single factor, a single tent-shaped linear combination of forward rates, predicts excess returns on one- to five-year maturity bonds with R2 up to 0.44. The return-forecasting factor is countercyclical and forecasts stock returns. An important component of the return-forecasting factor is unrelated to the level, slope, and curvature movements described by most term structure models. We document that measurement errors do not affect our central results. "
"1669","10.1257/0002828053828518","9501","This paper introduces methods to compute impulse responses without specification and estimation of the underlying multivariate dynamic system. The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages. "

This lowered the cost of having children.A model is developed in an attempt to account, quantitatively, for both the baby boom and bust. "

Welfare is also affected by quantity of life, however, as represented by longevity. This paper incorporates longevity into an overall assessment of the evolution of cross-country inequality and shows that it is quantitatively important. The absence of reduction in cross-country inequality up to the 1990s documented in previous work is in stark contrast to the reduction in inequality after incorporating gains in longevity. Throughout the post&ndash;World War II period, health contributed to reduce significantly welfare inequality across countries. This paper derives valuation formulas for infra-marginal changes in longevity and computes a ""full"" growth rate that incorporates the gains in health experienced by 96 countries for the period between 1960 and 2000. Incorporating longevity gains changes traditional results; countries starting with lower income tended to grow faster than countries starting with higher income. We estimate an average yearly growth in ""full income"" of 4.1 percent for the poorest 50 percent of countries in 1960, of which 1.7 percentage points are due to health, as opposed to a growth of 2.6 percent for the richest 50 percent of countries, of which only 0.4 percentage points are due to health. Additionally, we decompose changes in life expectancy into changes attributable to 13 broad groups of causes of death and three age groups. We show that mortality from infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases, congenital, perinatal, and ""ill-defined"" conditions, mostly concentrated before age 20 and between ages 20 and 50, is responsible for most of the reduction in life expectancy inequality. At the same time, the recent effect of AIDS, together with reductions in mortality after age 50&mdash;due to nervous system, senses organs, heart and circulatory diseases&mdash;contributed to increase health inequality across countries.

In the model, timely delivery is important because it allows retailers to respond to final demand fluctuations without holding costly inventories, and timely delivery is possible only from nearby locations. Using a unique dataset that allows us to measure the retail demand for timely delivery, we show that the sources of U.S. apparel imports have shifted in the way predicted by the model, with products for which timeliness matters increasingly imported from nearby countries.

The type of tax-base restrictions that we consider places limits on the tax instruments that the government can use to raise revenue, but not on the level of expenditures or debt. We show that the introduction of a constitutional amendment requiring that IPGs and debt be financed with land taxes makes intergenerational expropriation impossible and, for many cases of interest, induces optimal investment in IPGs. We also show that a weaker constitutional amendment requiring that IPGs be financed with land taxes, but imposing no restrictions on how to finance the debt, has a positive impact on IPGs, but not on expropriation.

"1781","10.1257/0002828054201387","9503","We conduct experiments to explore the possibility that subject misconceptions, as opposed to a particular theory of preferences referred to as the ""endowment effect,"" account for reported gaps between willingness to pay (""WTP"") and willingness to accept (""WTA""). The literature reveals two important facts. First, there is no consensus regarding the nature or robustness of WTP-WTA gaps. Second, while experimenters are careful to control for subject misconceptions, there is no consensus about the fundamental properties of misconceptions or how to avoid them. Instead, by implementing different types of experimental controls, experimenters have revealed notions of how misconceptions arise. Experimenters have applied these controls separately or in different combinations. Such controls include ensuring subject anonymity, using incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms, and providing subjects with practice and training on the elicitation mechanism before employing it to measure valuations. The pattern of results reported in the literature suggests that the widely differing reports of WTP-WTA gaps could be due to an incomplete science regarding subject misconceptions. We implement a ""revealed theory"" methodology to compensate for the lack of a theory of misconceptions. Theories implicit in experimental procedures found in the literature are at the heart of our experimental design. Thus, our approach to addressing subject misconceptions reflects an attempt to control simultaneously for all dimensions of concern over possible subject misconceptions found in the literature. To this end, our procedures modify the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism used in previous studies to elicit values. In addition, our procedures supplement commonly used procedures by providing extensive training on the elicitation mechanism before subjects provide WTP and WTA responses. Experiments were conducted using both lotteries and mugs, goods frequently used in endowment effect experiments. Using the modified procedures, we observe no gap between WTA and WTP. Therefore, our results call into question the interpretation of observed gaps as evidence of loss aversion or prospect theory. Further evidence is required before convincing interpretations of observed gaps can be advanced. "

This trade and the associated colonialism affected Europe not only directly, but also indirectly by inducing institutional change. Where ""initial"" political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights.

Matching economizes on the need for high-powered incentives. It can also, however, entrench bureaucratic conservatism and resistance to innovations.

In contrast, as with constant types, the optimal contract can be renegotiation-proof, even with highly persistent types.

Do big economies export larger quantities of each good (the intensive margin), a wider set of goods (the extensive margin), or higher-quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size. Models with quality differentiation, meanwhile, can match the price facts. Finally, models with fixed costs of exporting to a given market might explain the tendency of larger economies to export a given product to more countries. "

The latter assumption captures local interactions. Despite the fact that the rational expectations equilibrium (REE) is characterized by a simple pricing rule that firms can easily adopt, the economy does not converge to the REE for all parameter values. When the volatility of monetary innovations is low and interactions among firms are high, the aggregate price level exhibits rigidity, in that it does not fully react to contemporaneous aggregate demand shocks.

In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well.

The paper tests the following argument: if innovative activity is motivated by expected profits, and if the effectiveness of patent protection varies across industries, then innovation in countries without patent laws should focus on industries where alternative mechanisms to protect intellectual property are effective. Analyses of exhibition data for 12 countries in 1851 and 10 countries in 1876 indicate that inventors in countries without patent laws focused on a small set of industries where patents were less important, while innovation in countries with patent laws appears to be much more diversified. These findings suggest that patents help to determine the direction of technical change and that the adoption of patent laws in countries without such laws may alter existing patterns of comparative advantage across countries.

"1842","10.1257/000282806776157759","9601","We examine the role of banks in the transmission of monetary policy. In economies where banks use real demand deposits to finance their lending, fluctuations in the timing of production can force banks to scramble for real liquidity, or even fail, which can greatly affect lending and aggregate output. The adverse effect on output can be reduced if banks finance with nominal deposits. Nominal deposits also open a ""financial liquidity"" channel for monetary policy to affect real activity. The banking system may be better off, however, issuing real deposits (e.g., foreign exchange denominated) under some circumstances. "

With coefficients allowed to change, the best fit is with change only in the monetary policy rule and there are three estimated regimes corresponding roughly to periods when most observers believe that monetary policy actually differed. But the differences among regimes are not large enough to account for the rise, then decline, in inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Our estimates imply monetary targeting was central in the early 1980s, but also important sporadically in the 1970s. "
"1844","10.1257/000282806776157696","9601","Trade sanctions are often criticized as ineffective because they create incentives for evasion or as harmful to the target country's population. Loan sanctions, in contrast, could be self-enforcing and could protect the population from being saddled with ""odious debt"" run up by looting or repressive dictators. Governments could impose loan sanctions by instituting legal changes that prevent seizure of countries' assets for nonrepayment of debt incurred after sanctions were imposed. This would reduce creditors' incentives to lend to sanctioned regimes. Restricting sanctions to cover only loans made after the sanction was imposed would help avoid time-consistency problems. "

We analyze a monopoly firm's choice of advertising content and the information disclosed to consumers. The firm advertises only product information, price information, or both, and prefers to convey only limited product information if possible. It is socially harmful to force it to provide full information if it has sufficient ability to parse the information imparted, nor does it help to restrict the information voluntarily provided. "
"1846","10.1257/000282806776157588","9601","Previous experiments using the minimum-effort coordination game reveal a striking regularity&mdash;large groups never coordinate efficiently. Given the frequency with which large real-world groups, such as firms, face similarly difficult coordination problems, this poses an important question: Why do we observe large, successfully coordinated groups in the real world when they are so difficult to create in the laboratory? This paper presents one reason. The experiments show that, even though efficient coordination does not occur in groups that start off large, efficiently coordinated large groups can be ""grown."" By starting with small groups that find it easier to coordinate, we can add entrants&mdash;who are aware of the group's history&mdash;to create efficiently coordinated large groups. This represents the first experimental demonstration of large groups tacitly coordinated at high levels of efficiency. "

Our test of relative racial prejudice provides a partial solution to the well-known infra-marginality and omitted-variables problems associated with outcome tests. When applied to a unique dataset from Florida, our tests soundly reject the hypothesis that troopers of different races are monolithic in their search behavior, but the tests fail to reject the hypothesis that troopers of different races do not exhibit relative racial prejudice.

The magnitude of this impact provides a rare opportunity to (a) estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) of high school that come close to population average treatment effects (ATE); and (b) estimate returns to education using a regression discontinuity design instead of previous estimates that rely on difference-in-differences methodology or relatively weak instruments. Comparing LATE estimates for the United States and Canada, where very few students were affected by compulsory school laws, to the United Kingdom estimates provides a test as to whether instrumental variables (IV) returns to schooling often exceed ordinary least squares (OLS) because gains are high only for small and peculiar groups among the more general population. I find, instead, that the benefits from compulsory schooling are very large whether these laws have an impact on a majority or minority of those exposed. "

In fact, even today the military continues to sell subsidized tobacco products on its bases. Using a variety of instrumental variables approaches to deal with nonrandom selection into the military and into smoking, we provide substantial evidence that cohorts with higher military participation rates subsequently suffered more premature mortality. More importantly, we show that a large fraction, 35 to 79 percent, of the excess veteran deaths due to heart disease and lung cancer are attributable to military-induced smoking. "

Individuals distort investments toward skills that most managers can evaluate. Dynamically, when workers become managers, managerial expertise can become increasingly skewed over time, raising investment distortions and reducing output. If firms select managerial expertise strategically, efficient investments can be retrieved when (a) identifying whether workers' skills matter more than distinguishing among skilled workers, and (b) initial investment distortions are small. Otherwise, such strategic design worsens long-run outcomes. Finally, we determine when short-run affirmative action policies are effective. "

This task requires a true skill which we show to be unaffected by physical attractiveness. We find a sizable beauty premium and can identify three transmission channels: (a) physically attractive workers are more confident and higher confidence increases wages; (b) for a given level of confidence, physically attractive workers are (wrongly) considered more able by employers; (c) controlling for worker confidence, physically attractive workers have oral skills (such as communication and social skills) that raise their wages when they interact with employers. Our methodology can be adopted to study the sources of discriminatory pay differentials in other settings. "

Inequality increased until 1914 because industrial and financial estates grew dramatically. Then, adverse shocks, rather than a Kuznets-type process, led to a massive decline in inequality. The very high wealth concentration prior to 1914 benefited retired individuals living off capital income (rentiers) rather than entrepreneurs. The very rich were in their seventies and eighties, whereas they had been in their fifties a half century earlier and would be so again after World War II. Our results shed new light on ongoing debates about wealth inequality and growth. "
"1853","10.1257/000282806776157533","9601","This paper describes how wealth inequality may distort public resource allocation. A government seeks to allocate limited resources to productive sectors, but sectoral productivity is privately known by agents with vested interests in those sectors. They lobby the government for preferential treatment. The government&mdash;even if it honestly seeks to maximize economic efficiency&mdash;may be confounded by the possibility that both high wealth and true economic desirability create loud lobbies. Broadly speaking, both poorer economies and unequal economies display greater public misallocation. The paper warns against the conventional wisdom that this is so because such governments are more ""corrupt."" "

We show how such concepts as prudence and temperance can be fully characterized by a preference relation over these lotteries. If preferences are defined in an expected-utility framework with differentiable utility, the direction of preference for a particular class of lottery pairs is equivalent to signing the nth derivative of the utility function. What makes our characterization appealing is its simplicity, which seems particularly amenable to experimentation. "

Individual records from Dutch registers of birth, marriage, and death, covering a window of unprecedented size (1912-2000) are merged with historical data on macroeconomic and health indicators. We correct for secular changes over time and other mortality determinants. We nonparametrically compare those born in a recession to those born in the preceding boom, and we estimate duration models where the individual's mortality rate depends on current conditions, conditions early in life, age individual characteristics, including individual socio-economic indicators, and interaction terms. The results indicate a significant negative effect of economic conditions early in life on individual mortality rates at all ages. "

In response, many studies employ a ""hybrid"" specification in which inflation depends on its lagged and expected future values, together with a driving variable such as the output gap. We consider some simple tests of the hybrid model that are derived from its closed form. We find that the hybrid model describes inflation dynamics poorly, and find little empirical evidence for the type of rational, forward-looking behavior that the model implies. "

We find that our marginal cost estimates are very much in line with the detailed cost accounting data. We show that the cement cartel has been ineffective because the sharing rule induces ""overproduction"" and exporting below marginal costs. It is consumers -- not firms -- who benefit from the sharing rule. The ineffectiveness of the cartel was becoming so large that domestic welfare of a merger to monopoly would be positive around 1968, which is when the merger actually took place! We also show that competition would have resulted in even higher welfare gains over the entire sample. "

This raises serious questions about existing work that finds a labor productivity shock has a strong negative effect on employment. There are tantalizing and interesting differences between TFP and labor productivity. We argue that TFP is a more natural measure of technology because labor productivity reflects shifts in the input mix as well as in technology. "

According to a standard textbook argument, a Pareto improvement can be obtained by eliminating the distortions, compensating the losers with a lump sum transfer, and redistributing the gains that are left over. We relax the assumption that winners know the losses suffered by the losers and show that the informationally efficient method of compensating losers may involve the use of seemingly inefficient (but informationally efficient) distortionary policies. The risk of overcompensating losers may make distortions informationally efficient, as there are points on the Pareto frontier where distortions are used. "

This paper examines the role of NT as it applies to internal taxation under the GATT. It is shown that despite severely restricting the freedom to set internal taxes, NT may improve government welfare, but it will not completely solve the incomplete contract problem it is meant to remedy. Furthermore, it requires a high degree of economic sophistication on behalf of trade negotiators in order for this beneficial effect to materialize. "

We introduce collective bargaining, differences in inter industry labor mobility, and trade union lobbying into the protection-for-sale model, and show that the equilibrium protection rate in our model depends upon these labor market variables.

Inefficient rent seeking can overturn prominent implications of the property rights theory.

Local newspapers reposition toward local and away from national coverage, raising circulation among individuals without a degree.
