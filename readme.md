Quantifying Precise Quantitative Statements in Abstracts
=========================================================

Just about 10% of empirical articles in recent volumes of APSR (see below) have abstracts with precise quantitative statements. But nearly 35% of the empirical papers in the AER do the same. We discuss reasons behind why so few articles contain precise numerical statements in their abstracts and some potential implications.
